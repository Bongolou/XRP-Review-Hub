To ensure your site is ready for monetization and meets high-quality standards, consider the following best practices and tips:

Original and Engaging Content: Focus on creating unique, engaging content that adds value for visitors. Avoid repurposing existing content without adding new insights or perspectives.
Coherent and Focused Articles: Ensure your articles are coherent and focused on a well-defined subject. Avoid spreading your content too thin across a broad range of topics. This helps in maintaining a clear niche and enhances user engagement.
Avoiding Duplicate Content: Steer clear of duplicating content from other reputable sites. Always aim to provide original content that stands out in its uniqueness.
SEO-Friendly Length: Write articles that are typically around 800 - 1,000 words. This word count range is generally optimal for SEO and helps in providing comprehensive coverage of the topic.
Avoid Keyword Stuffing: Ensure your content flows naturally and is written for readers, not search engines. Overusing keywords to manipulate rankings can lead to penalties.
Quality Over Quantity: While it’s important to have more than 15 articles to meet monetization requirements, the focus should remain on the quality of the content. Each article should be well-written, informative, and free of errors.
Review AI-Generated Content: If you are using AI tools to generate content, meticulously review and refine the output to ensure it meets quality standards and adds genuine value.
Avoid Prohibited Content: Make sure your site does not include prohibited articles such as those containing spammy redirects, download links, or content outside your niche. These can negatively impact your site’s reputation and compliance with content policies.
Establish Trust: Include a detailed About Us page and list named authors or bylines on every post. Make sure your social media links work properly and lead to the correct profiles.
Keep It Consistent: Use the same branding and design elements throughout your site. Choose a domain name that matches your site's name. 
By following these best practices, you can enhance the quality and credibility of your site, making it better suited for monetization and improving user experience.
